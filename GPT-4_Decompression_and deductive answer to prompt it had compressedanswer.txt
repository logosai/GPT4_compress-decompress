It looks like you are trying to create a simple human-like form using basic geometric shapes, perform transformations, and export it as an STL file using the trimesh library. I'll provide a more readable version of the code snippet with proper syntax:

python
Copy code
import trimesh
import numpy as np

# Create basic shapes for the human form
head = trimesh.creation.Sphere(0.5, subdivisions=2)
body = trimesh.creation.Cylinder(0.25, 2)
left_arm = trimesh.creation.Cylinder(0.125, 1.5)
right_arm = trimesh.creation.Cylinder(0.125, 1.5)
left_leg = trimesh.creation.Cylinder(0.125, 2)
right_leg = trimesh.creation.Cylinder(0.125, 2)

# Set up transformation matrix
xfrm = trimesh.transformations.rotation_matrix
pi = np.pi

# Translate the parts to form a human shape
parts = [
    (head, [0, 0, 3.5]),
    (body, [0, 0, 1.5]),
    (left_arm, [-0.75, 0, 2.5]),
    (right_arm, [0.75, 0, 2.5]),
    (left_leg, [-0.25, 0, 0.5]),
    (right_leg, [0.25, 0, 0.5])
]

for part, translation in parts:
    part.apply_translation(translation)

# Rotate the arms and legs
rotations = [
    (left_arm, -pi/6, (0, 1, 0)),
    (right_arm, pi/6, (0, 1, 0)),
    (left_leg, pi/6, (0, 1, 0)),
    (right_leg, -pi/6, (0, 1, 0))
]

for part, angle, axis in rotations:
    part.apply_transform(xfrm(angle, axis))

# Combine the parts into a single mesh
human_form = trimesh.util.concatenate(tuple(parts))

# Scale the mesh to fit within a bounding box
scale = 0.1 / human_form.bounds[:, 2].ptp()
human_form.apply_scale(scale)

# Export the mesh as an STL file
human_form.export('human_form.stl')
This code will create a human-like form using spheres and cylinders, perform translations and rotations, then export the final mesh as an STL file called "human_form.stl".
